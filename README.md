# Unhandled JSON Decoding and API Error Handling in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart code when fetching data from an API:  incorrectly assuming the response is always a JSON list and lacking robust error handling and retry mechanisms. The `bug.dart` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.dart` file presents a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The `fetchData` function makes an HTTP request.  It fails to handle various scenarios properly:

1. **Incorrect JSON Assumption:** It assumes the API always returns a JSON list (`List<dynamic>`). If the API returns a JSON object, a different data type, or an error message, the `jsonDecode` will throw an exception.
2. **Insufficient Error Handling:** The `catch` block only prints the error to the console; it doesn't implement any retry logic or more sophisticated error handling.
3. **Missing Status Code Checks:** It checks for a status code of 200 but doesn't handle other status codes, such as 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Internal Server Error), which might provide valuable diagnostic information.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file addresses these issues:

1. **Type Safety:** It uses `dynamic` to handle various JSON structures.
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling:** It includes a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions during the JSON decoding process and includes retry logic to handle transient network errors.
3. **Status Code Handling:** It explicitly checks for various status codes and processes the response accordingly.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and type safety in asynchronous Dart code.
